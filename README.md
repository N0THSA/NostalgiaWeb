# NostalgiaWeb
Archive.org scraper for Wayback Machine.

Warning: VERY slow when scraping websites for the first time, less slow (but still slow) when loading normally.
Recommended to use Internet Explorer 7 or retro computers when self hosting.

Web Proxy Connect: operating-relying.at.playit.gg:52710
For the public one, use whatever was avalible at the time.
Will load websites within 365 days (one year) of 13 years ago today.


Thank you richardg867 for your WaybackProxy that I learned from, and even used some code from here: https://github.com/richardg867/WaybackProxy
